        Welcome to Full House Learning Center, where every child's potential is nurtured, and
        their
        journey of learning is filled with love growth and purpose. Established in 2001 under the
        name Complete in Christ Kiddie Center, our school began by catering to young children ages
        3-5. Since 2016, we have evolved into a formal educational institution offering both
        preschool and elementary programs, committed to developing well-rounded and capable
        learners.

        Our school's achievements are a testament to our dedication to excellence. Many of our
        students have successfully passed entrance exams to Pasig City Science High School, while
        others studying abroad meet and exceed international standards, ensuring smooth
        transitions
        to their new schools. Our alumni who have transferred to prestigious institutions like
        Ateneo de Manila University and the University of the Philippines Integrated School are
        often commended for their proficiency in reading, reflecting the strong academic
        foundation
        they built with us.

        At Full House Learning Center, we create an atmosphere where students feel a strong sense
        of
        belonging, every child has the opportunity to showcase their talents and skills through
        various school programs. Our curriculum continues to grow to meet the demands of the 21st
        century, with programs in reading and literacy, coding and robotics, Singapore Math, and
        scouting activities, all aimed at equipping students with essential skills for the future.
        Looking ahead, we remain committed to enhancing each student's holistic development,
        continuously introducing programs that will prepare them to be responsible, God-fearing
        citizens. Our vision is clear, we focus on the unique gifts and capabilities of every
        child,
        allowing them to engage in experiential activities that develop them fully as they grow
        into
        compassionate and capable individuals.
