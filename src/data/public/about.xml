    Welcome to Full House Learning Center, where every childâ€™s potential is nurtured, and 
    their journey of learning is filled with love, growth, and progress. Established in 2001 
    under the name Complete in Christ Kiddie Center, our school began by catering to young 
    children ages 3-5. Since 2016, we have evolved into a formal educational institution 
    offering both preschool and elementary programs, committed to developing well-rounded and
    capable learners.

    Our school's achievements are a testament to our dedication to excellence. Many of our 
    students have successfully passed entrance exams to Pasig City Science High School, while 
    others studying abroad meet and exceed international standards, ensuring smooth transitions 
    to their new schools. Our alumni who have transferred to prestigious institutions like 
    Ateneo de Manila University and the University of the Philippines Integrated School are 
    often commended for their proficiency in reading, reflecting the strong academic foundation
    they built with us.
